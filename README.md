# Cloud Foundry Staticfile Buildpack

[![CF Slack](https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.slack.com) Join us on Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/buildpacks/)

A Cloud Foundry [buildpack](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/) for static content such as websites (HTML/JS/CSS).

### Buildpack User Documentation

Official buildpack documentation can be found at http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/staticfile/index.html.

### Building the Buildpack

1. Make sure you have fetched submodules

  ```bash
  git submodule update --init
  ```

1. Get latest buildpack dependencies

  ```shell
  BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle
  ```

1. Build the buildpack

  ```shell
  BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec buildpack-packager [ --cached | --uncached ]
  ```

1. Use in Cloud Foundry

  Upload the buildpack to your Cloud Foundry and optionally specify it by name

  ```bash
  cf create-buildpack custom_node_buildpack node_buildpack-offline-custom.zip 1
  cf push my_app -b custom_node_buildpack
  ```

### Testing
Buildpacks use the [Machete](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/machete) framework for running integration tests.

To test a buildpack, run the following command from the buildpack's directory:

```
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=cf.Gemfile bundle exec buildpack-build
```

More options can be found on Machete's [Github page.](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/machete)

### Acknowledgements

This buildpack is based heavily upon Jordon Bedwell's Heroku buildpack and the modifications by David Laing for Cloud Foundry [nginx-buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/nginx-buildpack). It has been tuned for usability (configurable with `Staticfile`) and to be included as a default buildpack (detects `Staticfile` rather than the presence of an `index.html`). Thanks for the buildpack Jordon!
